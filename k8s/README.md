- Ingress \
It is route data from HTTP and HTTPS external sources to internal services in cluster
- Ingress controller \
It is used by Ingress resource for running. Also it is not start with cluster, we need to start it by hand
- StatefulSet
It is object for managing stateful applications - manage their storages, guarantees that Pods of cluster will be unique

It created a copy of some defined Pod on all defined Nodes in cluster
- PersistentVolumes \
This resources needs for managing storages in clusters.
