## Best practises of Python
* Use PEP8 guide
* Write modular and non-repetitive code
* Proper documentation
* Using venv and requirements.txt
## Framework
For this application I chose framework Flask because it is one of the most famous frameworks for Python and it is relatively simple and small - it is perfect solution for such small applications (and not only).
* Pros
  * Simple
  * Small
  * Power enough
* Cons
  * Scale - slower if there are a lot of requests
  * Modules and security
## Used Linters
* Markdown: [mdformat](https://github.com/executablebooks/mdformat)
* Python: [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)
